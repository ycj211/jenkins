CLI.Usage=Jenkins CLI\n\
  Usage: java -jar jenkins-cli.jar [-s URL] command [opts...] args...\n\
  Options:\n\
  \ -s URL              : the server URL (defaults to the JENKINS_URL env var)\n\
  \ -http               : use a plain CLI protocol over HTTP(S) (the default; mutually exclusive with -ssh and -remoting)\n\
  \ -ssh                : use SSH protocol (requires -user; SSH port must be open on server, and user must have registered a public key)\n\
  \ -remoting           : use deprecated Remoting channel protocol (if enabled on server; for compatibility with legacy commands or command modes only)\n\
  \ -i KEY              : SSH private key file used for authentication (for use with -ssh or -remoting)\n\
  \ -p HOST:PORT        : HTTP proxy host and port for HTTPS proxy tunneling. See https://jenkins.io/redirect/cli-https-proxy-tunnel\n\
  \ -noCertificateCheck : bypass HTTPS certificate check entirely. Use with caution\n\
  \ -noKeyAuth          : don't try to load the SSH authentication private key. Conflicts with -i\n\
  \ -user               : specify user (for use with -ssh)\n\
  \ -strictHostKey      : request strict host key checking (for use with -ssh)\n\
  \ -logger FINE        : enable detailed logging from the client\n\
  \ -auth [ USER:SECRET | @FILE ] : specify username and either password or API token (or load from them both from a file);\n\
  \                                 for use with -http, or -remoting but only when the JNLP agent port is disabled.\n\
  \                                 Passing crendentials by a file is recommended.\n\
  \                                 See https://jenkins.io/redirect/cli-http-connection-mode for more info and options.\n\
